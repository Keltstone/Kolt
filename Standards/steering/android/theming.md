# Theme Module

Self-contained — the shape below works with zero Kolt dependency, so if
`Kolt/libs` isn't in the workspace, implement the contract directly. **If it
is present, use it instead of writing this module from scratch** —
`compose-kmp/src/*/theme/` (`Theme.kt`, `Color.kt`, `Dimens.kt`, `AppFont.kt`,
`TextStyles.kt`) already implements this exact pattern, and per
[kolt-libs.md](kolt-libs.md) it's a vetted "reuse as-is" — not optional once
it's there. It's KMP-authored (real `expect`/`actual` across `commonMain`/
`androidMain`/`iosMain`/`desktopMain`), which is irrelevant baggage for an
Android-only app but not a problem — it compiles and runs as a normal
dependency, you just never touch the non-`androidMain` source sets.

## Shape

No `expect`/`actual` needed here — this is a single-platform module, so a
plain `object`/interface set is enough. `CompositionLocal` is still the
right mechanism (testable overrides, no global mutable state, scoped
overrides for one screen without touching every call site):

```kotlin
// :theme module
val LocalColors = staticCompositionLocalOf<BaseColors> { error("No colors provided") }
val LocalTypography = staticCompositionLocalOf<BaseTextStyles> { error("No typography provided") }
val LocalSizes = staticCompositionLocalOf<Sizes> { error("No sizes provided") }

object AppTheme {
    val colors: BaseColors @Composable @ReadOnlyComposable get() = LocalColors.current
    val typography: BaseTextStyles @Composable @ReadOnlyComposable get() = LocalTypography.current
    val sizes: Sizes @Composable @ReadOnlyComposable get() = LocalSizes.current
}

@Composable
fun AppThemeProvider(
    isDarkTheme: Boolean? = null,   // null = follow system
    content: @Composable () -> Unit,
) {
    val darkTheme = isDarkTheme ?: isSystemInDarkTheme()
    val colors = if (darkTheme) DarkColors else LightColors
    CompositionLocalProvider(LocalColors provides colors, LocalTypography provides AppTypography, LocalSizes provides AppSizes) {
        MaterialTheme(colorScheme = colors.toMaterialColorScheme(), typography = AppTypography.toMaterialTypography()) {
            content()
        }
    }
}
```

If using Kolt's version instead, `Theme.android.kt` is the worked example
(dark/light resolution, font loading) — just note it's the `actual` for one
platform among several; you only need what's in that file, not the
`iosMain`/`desktopMain` siblings.

## Material 3 Expressive

Current Material3 (`developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/material3`,
updated June 2026) adds `MaterialExpressiveTheme` and a `motionScheme`
parameter (`MotionScheme.expressive()` / `.standard()`) alongside the usual
`colorScheme`/`typography`/`shapes`. Treat `motionScheme` as another token
this module owns — expose it through the same provider (`AppThemeProvider`)
and `CompositionLocal` set as colors/typography, don't hardcode
`MaterialExpressiveTheme` vs `MaterialTheme` per screen.

## Strings / i18n

Same "no hardcoded token outside its module" shape as colors/dimens, applied
to user-facing text: use Android's standard resource system —
`stringResource(R.string.x)` in Compose, backed by `res/values/strings.xml`
(and `res/values-<locale>/strings.xml` per locale) — not a literal string
typed into a composable. (Compose Multiplatform resources
(`compose.resources`) are the KMP steering set's equivalent; don't reach for
that dependency here, it's solving a cross-platform problem this app doesn't
have.)

## Kolt title / body sets

If reusing Kolt, `Kolt.typography` has two complete copies of the size scale
below: `title` for titles/headings and `body` for running text. Pick the set,
then the size, then the weight with an extension:

```kotlin
Kolt.typography.title.xLarge.bold
Kolt.typography.body.medium
Kolt.typography.body.xSmall.light
```

Size names drop the `text` prefix (`xSmall`, `medium`, `xLargeMid`, `giant`, …).
Today both sets hold the same styles (same instances, no extra copies); they
diverge once titles get their own font. The flat `text*` steps
(`Kolt.typography.textXLarge`) are deprecated and removed in 0.3.0. Other roles
(display/headline/label) are on hold until per-role fonts are needed.
`CompositionBaseProvider` also fills `MaterialTheme.typography` from the Kolt
scale, so Material components use the Kolt font.

The old flat `Kolt.typography.bodyMedium`/`titleLarge`/… aliases are
deprecated: their sizes don't match Material3 (e.g. `bodyLarge` was 18 sp).
Each one's `ReplaceWith` points at the identical `body.*` step, so auto-fix
doesn't change how anything looks.

## Kolt type scale

If reusing Kolt, `Kolt.typography.body.x` / `title.x` map 1:1 to `Kolt.sizes.fontSizeX`
(sp values below are the Android `values/dimens.xml` / desktop defaults):

| sp | Slot | sp | Slot |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | `body.minimum` | 17 | `body.mediumLargeMid` (added 0.2.1-dev2) |
| 7 | `body.tiny` | 18 | `body.large` |
| 8 | `body.xxxSmall` | 20 | `body.xLarge` |
| 9 | `body.xxSmall` | 22 | `body.xLargeMid` (added 0.2.1-dev2) |
| 10 | `body.xSmall` | 24 | `body.xxLarge` |
| 11 | `body.xSmallMedium` | 28 | `body.xxxLarge` |
| 12 | `body.small` | 32 | `body.big` |
| 13 | `body.smallMedium` | 36 | `body.xBig` |
| 14 | `body.medium` | 40 | `body.huge` |
| 15 | `body.mediumMid` | 48 | `body.giant` |
| 16 | `body.mediumLarge` | | |

The two `…Mid` slots added in 0.2.1-dev2 are appended at the **end** of the
`Sizes`/`UiSizes`/`BaseTextStyles` constructors (not in scale order) so existing
positional args and `componentN()` stay stable. New slots follow the same
append-only rule.

## Kolt size scale

If reusing Kolt, every dimension comes from `Kolt.sizes` (dp; Android `values/dimens.xml` /
desktop defaults). Pick the family by *what* is being sized, then the step:

| Family | Use for | Steps (dp) |
|---|---|---|
| `padding*` | padding, `PaddingValues`, `spacedBy`, `Spacer` | Tiny 1, XXSmall 2, XSmall 4, XSmallPlus 6, Small 8, SmallMedium 12, Medium 16, Large 20, XLarge 24, XXLarge 32, XXXLarge 40, XXXXLarge 48, Giant 56 |
| `cornerRadius*` | shapes | Small 3, Medium 4, Normal 8, MediumLarge 12, Large 16, XLarge 20, XXLarge 24, XXXLarge 32 |
| `icon*` | icons, spinners | XSmall 8, Small 16, Medium 20, Standard 24, StandardLarge 28, Large 32, XLarge 40, XXLarge 48, XXXLarge 56, XXXXLarge 64, Big 80, Giant 128 |
| `size*` | other element sizes: button/row/bar heights, dots, boxes | XXXSmall 8, XXSmall 16, XSmall 24, Small 32, SmallMedium 36, Medium 40, MediumLarge 48, Large 56, XLarge 64, XXLarge 80, XXXLarge 96, Giant 128 |
| `image*` | avatars, thumbnails, illustrations | XXSmall 24, XSmall 32, Small 40, SmallMedium 48, SmallMediumPlus 56, Medium 64, MediumLarge 80, Large 96, XLarge 120, XXLarge 160, XXXLarge 200, Huge 240, Giant 320 |

`size*`, `image*` (incl. `imageSmallMediumPlus`) were added in 0.2.1-dev3, appended at the
**end** of `Sizes`/`UiSizes` — same append-only rule as the type scale. An app that provides
its own `LocalSizes` (a theme bridge) starts from `KoltDefaults.sizes()` and `copy()`s only
what differs; a bare `Sizes(...)` leaves every other field `Unspecified` (NaN at draw time).
A value off every scale (e.g. 14/18/22 dp icons, 0.75 dp hairlines) or pure layout geometry
(breakpoints, fixed panel widths) stays a named constant in the theme/dimens module, not a
token.

## Rules

- **Kolt tokens first.** Whenever Kolt is available (in the workspace, an `includeBuild`, a copied module, or an `io.github.keltstone.kolt` dependency), always
  use its tokens for anything it covers: colors (`Kolt.colors.*`), padding,
  spacing, corner radius, icon/button sizes (`Kolt.sizes.*`), and text
  (`Kolt.typography.title.*` / `Kolt.typography.body.*`, weight via `.bold` etc.). Don't hand-write a
  literal or define a parallel `AppTheme` token that duplicates one. Only a
  value Kolt genuinely lacks gets an app token, added in the app's `:theme`
  module next to the Kolt ones. A raw value is allowed only when computed at
  runtime, with a one-line comment saying why.
- No `Color(0xFF...)`, `.sp`, `.dp` literals outside the `:theme` module.
  Screens reference `AppTheme.colors.primary`, `AppTheme.sizes.spacingM`, etc.
- No string literals for user-facing text in a composable — `stringResource(R.string.x)`.
  (Log messages, internal tags, and test-only strings are fine as literals;
  this rule is about text a user sees.)
- Conditions (dark mode, dynamic color, locale-driven font) are parameters to
  the provider composable, not `if` branches scattered through screens.
- One `AppThemeProvider` call, at the root of the single Activity (see
  [navigation.md](navigation.md)) — not per screen, not per journey.
- Text uses the `title` or `body` set (`Kolt.typography.title.xLarge.bold`,
  `Kolt.typography.body.medium`), with weight as an extension.
- **Replace old tokens with the current ones.** Whenever you touch code that uses
  a deprecated Kolt token, move it to the current token in the same change —
  don't leave it for later and don't add new uses. Follow the deprecation's
  `ReplaceWith`: `Kolt.typography.textXLarge` becomes `Kolt.typography.body.xLarge`
  (or `title.xLarge` if it styles a title or heading), and the flat
  `bodyMedium`/`titleLarge`/… aliases become the `body.*` step they name. Same for
  any other `@Deprecated` Kolt token (colors, sizes, components).
- Use a Kolt typography slot for any size on the scale; a raw
  `TextStyle(fontSize = …)` is only allowed for runtime-computed sizes
  (cell-proportional, user text-size multiplier, platform branch) and must
  carry a one-line comment saying why.
- If reusing Kolt: spacing uses `Kolt.sizes.padding*`, corners `cornerRadius*`, icons `icon*`,
  images/illustrations `image*` (24–320dp),
  and every other element dimension (button/row/bar heights, avatars, dots) `size*` (8–128dp).
  An app bridging its own `LocalSizes` starts from `KoltDefaults.sizes()` and `copy()`s only
  what differs.
- Adding a new design token (spacing, radius, elevation): add it to the
  `Sizes`/`Dimens` interface in `:theme`, not as a local `val` in a screen.
