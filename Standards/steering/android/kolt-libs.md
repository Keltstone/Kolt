# Kolt/libs — what's reusable and what isn't (optional)

**This whole file only applies if `Kolt/libs` is actually present in the
workspace.** Nothing elsewhere in this steering set requires it — every
pattern it documents (theme module, `AsyncState`, `MviViewModel`) is defined
standalone in [theming.md](theming.md) / [presentation-mvi.md](presentation-mvi.md)
and works with zero Kolt dependency. That's the only thing optional here —
*whether Kolt/libs exists in this workspace at all.* Once it's present, using
what's in [Reuse as-is](#reuse-as-is-mandatory-when-present) below is not
optional: don't write a new `KoltButton`, a new theme module, a new
`AsyncState`, etc. once a vetted one already exists a few files over — that's
exactly the duplication [architecture.md](architecture.md#reuse-over-duplication)
forbids.

`Kolt/libs` lives at `$KOLT_LIBS_PATH` (the local KoltLibs checkout; set it in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or ask the user). It's
KMP-authored, but that's a non-issue for an Android-only project — a
multiplatform Gradle module is a perfectly normal Android dependency, you
just never touch its `iosMain`/`desktopMain` source sets. **Because this
project has no non-Android target, almost everything in Kolt is usable here**
— including the `compose-utils` module, which the KMP steering set excludes
for being "Android-only despite living in a KMP repo." Here, Android-only is
exactly the target, so that objection doesn't apply. Checked each module on
its own merits below anyway — being usable isn't the same as being good.

## How to consume it — ask once, at project creation

Before wiring the first Kolt dependency into a new project, check whether
consumption is already decided: look for an `includeBuild(...)` pointing at
`Kolt/libs` in `settings.gradle.kts`, a copied module directory, or an
`io.github.keltstone.kolt` coordinate in the version catalog. If none of those exist
yet, **ask the user which mode to use — always, exactly once per project,
never silently default:**

1. **Composite build / direct link from disk** — `includeBuild("$koltLibsDir/build-logic")` in `pluginManagement {}` and `apply(from = "$koltLibsDir/gradle/kolt-consumer.settings.gradle.kts")` at the end of `settings.gradle.kts` with `koltLibsDir` defined in `gradle.properties` (or `settings.gradle.kts`). Not a copy: a live reference to the same files on this machine, edits in Kolt show up immediately with no publish step.
2. **Copy the module(s) in** — vendor the source into this project's tree. Portable across machines/CI, but you own drift from the source from that point on; no free updates.
3. **Gradle dependency on a published artifact** — `implementation("io.github.keltstone.kolt:<module>:<version>")` (note: `compose-utils` is published under artifact ID `compose`, i.e. `io.github.keltstone.kolt:compose:<version>`). Requires Kolt actually published (Maven local or remote) under that coordinate. Most portable/CI-friendly option, if publishing is set up.

Once answered, treat it as decided for the life of the project — don't
re-ask on later tasks; re-check the project state above instead.

## Composite-build rules (mandatory when Kolt is an `includeBuild`)

Any project in this workspace that consumes Kolt does so as a composite build — apps and
shared libraries alike — and **option 1 above is already decided**, don't re-ask.

1. **No versioned/published Kolt coordinates.** Never `io.github.koltsystems…`,
   `io.github.appspiriment…`, or a literal `io.github.keltstone.kolt:<module>:<version>` that
   only resolves from `~/.m2`/Maven. Declare Kolt libraries through the version catalog and let
   the included build *substitute* them.
2. **Apply Kolt plugins by raw ID, with no version** — `id("io.github.keltstone.kolt.application")`
   or `id("io.github.keltstone.kolt.library")`, never a catalog `alias(...)` with `version.ref`, and
   never `alias(...) apply false` for them in the root build. A version makes Gradle demand a published artifact.
3. **Every build that uses Kolt includes build-logic in `pluginManagement` and applies the shared script LAST:**
   `includeBuild("$koltLibsDir/build-logic")` in `pluginManagement {}` (plugins) and
   `apply(from = "$koltLibsDir/gradle/kolt-consumer.settings.gradle.kts")` at the very end of
   `settings.gradle.kts` (libraries substitution for every Kolt module). Use relative paths (e.g. `koltLibsDir=../../../KMP/Keltstone/KoltLibs` in `gradle.properties`).
4. **Depend on sibling projects by source, not by published jar.**
5. **Include order is significant: chained builds first, Kolt last.**
6. **Prove it before calling it done:** verify with `--offline`.

## External tooling coordinates

[tooling.md](tooling.md)'s enforcement stack, pinned:

```toml
# gradle/libs.versions.toml
[versions]
konsist = "0.17.3"
detekt = "1.23.7"
ktlintGradle = "12.1.1"

[libraries]
konsist = { module = "com.lemonappdev:konsist", version.ref = "konsist" }

[plugins]
detekt = { id = "io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt", version.ref = "detekt" }
ktlint = { id = "org.jlleitschuh.gradle.ktlint", version.ref = "ktlintGradle" }
```

Konsist is a plain JVM test dependency (`testImplementation`), not a Gradle
plugin. Bump these against each tool's own release notes before pinning —
don't carry stale versions forward from this doc indefinitely.

**Detekt custom rules live in Kolt, not per-app.** The two rules
[tooling.md](tooling.md#detekt-custom-rules) specifies (no hardcoded
`Color`/`.dp`/`.sp`, no plain collection in a `State`) are published once as
`io.github.keltstone.kolt:detekt-rules:<version>` — same module the KMP
steering set uses, consumed the same way as any other Kolt module (see
[How to consume it](#how-to-consume-it--ask-once-at-project-creation) above).
Writing a project-local `RuleSetProvider` for either of these duplicates a
module that already exists a few files over, exactly the
[architecture.md](architecture.md#reuse-over-duplication) violation this
whole doc exists to prevent.

## Reuse as-is (mandatory when present)

If `Kolt/libs` is in the workspace, use these — don't hand-write a new
equivalent and don't treat this as a "pick whichever you feel like" menu.

**Check the resolved version before reaching for a recently-added slot.**
Some tokens below are called out as added in a specific dev build (e.g.
`body.mediumLargeMid`/`body.xLargeMid` in 0.2.1-dev2, `size*`/`image*` in
0.2.1-dev3). If this project consumes Kolt via a pinned Gradle coordinate
rather than `includeBuild`/a copied module, confirm the pinned version
(version catalog / `build.gradle.kts`) actually includes a slot before using
it — an older pin won't have it, and the "always use Kolt tokens" mandate
isn't license to assume every slot documented here is present. If it's
missing, either bump the pin or fall back to the closest available slot,
don't hand-roll a literal.

**Tokens are part of the mandate.** Whenever Kolt is available (in the workspace, an `includeBuild`, a copied module, or an `io.github.keltstone.kolt` dependency),
every color, padding/spacing, corner radius, icon/button size and text style
comes from `Kolt.colors` / `Kolt.sizes` / `Kolt.typography`
when Kolt has one — no literals, no duplicate app tokens, and no deprecated Kolt tokens (replace them with the current one when you touch the code). Rules in
[theming.md](theming.md#rules).

| Module | Path | Why it's safe |
|---|---|---|
| `compose-kmp` theme | `compose-kmp/src/{commonMain,androidMain}/.../theme/` | `Kolt` object + `LocalColors`/`LocalTypography`/`LocalSizes` + `CompositionBaseProvider` is exactly the pattern in [theming.md](theming.md). You only need the `commonMain` + `androidMain` pieces. Text: `Kolt.typography.title.*` / `Kolt.typography.body.*` (full scale each, weight via `.bold` etc.), covering 6–48 sp incl. `body.mediumLargeMid` (17 sp) and `body.xLargeMid` (22 sp) — use a slot, not `TextStyle(fontSize = …)`. The old flat `Kolt.typography.text*` names for these same slots are deprecated, removed in 0.3.0 — don't reuse them even as an example; full scale in [theming.md](theming.md#kolt-type-scale). Sizes: `Kolt.sizes.padding*`/`cornerRadius*`/`icon*`/`size*`/`image*` — no raw `.dp` for anything on a scale; own `LocalSizes` starts from `KoltDefaults.sizes()`; families in [theming.md](theming.md#kolt-size-scale). |
| `compose-kmp` component library | `compose-kmp/src/commonMain/.../components/` — buttons, text/text fields, containers (card, accordion, tooltip, divider), messages (snackbar/banner/dialog), image, badges, progress, rating bar, slider, stepper, shimmer | The reusable-component target from [architecture.md](architecture.md#reuse-over-duplication) already built — check here before writing a new `KoltButton`/`KoltCard`/etc. |
| `compose-utils` components | dropdowns, `KoltTextField`/`KoltValidatedTextField`, `PageScaffold`, `KoltTopBar`, `KoltDrawerScaffold`, swipe-actions box, `Lottie`, `RememberSpeechToText`, photo picker | Genuinely Android-only, which is exactly this project's target — no mismatch. Same "check before writing a new one" rule as the `compose-kmp` set above. |
| `utils` → `AsyncState` | `utils/src/commonMain/.../state/AsyncState.kt` | Plain sealed class (`Idle`/`Loading`/`Success`/`Error`) with `map`/`onSuccess`/`getOrElse`. Use it in `State` fields per [presentation-mvi.md](presentation-mvi.md). |
| `logutils` | `logutils/` | Auto debug/release gating on Android via App Startup. Fine to use as-is. |
| `location` | `location/` | Fine if a journey needs location. |
| `location-picker` | `location-picker/` | All-in-one Search/Map/Current-location/Manual-entry picker UI built on `location` — `LocationPickerActivity` + `LocationPickerContract` for `registerForActivityResult`, or `LocationPicker.rememberLauncher` from Compose. Fine to consume as a black-box UI dependency for a "pick a location" screen. Follows this steering set (MVI, `ImmutableList` state, `compose-kmp` theme, test coverage); self-contained permission/services flow, no extra `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` request needed — full detail in [kolt-libs-reference.md](kolt-libs-reference.md) if you're integrating it. |

Also in `kolt-libs-reference.md`: why not to import `compose-utils`'
`KoltBanner`/`KoltBottomSheet`/`KoltSnackbar`/`DialogButtonStyle`/
`MessageDialog`/`ColorUtils` (they're backward-compat stubs for the
`compose-kmp` versions above — import from `compose-kmp` directly).

## Don't reuse

| Module | Path | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| `compose-utils` ViewModel bases | `compose-utils/.../utils/base/UiStateEventsViewModel.kt`, `UiStateEventsAndroidViewModel.kt`, `UiEventsViewModel.kt`, `UiEventsAndroidViewModel.kt` | Not excluded for being Android-only (that's fine here) — excluded because `UiStateEventsAndroidViewModel`/`UiEventsAndroidViewModel` extend `android.app.AndroidViewModel`, which current official guidance says to avoid (inject `Application`/context via DI instead), and the naming is confusing (`UiEventType` is used for one-shot *effects*, reads like *events*). Use the `MviViewModel` in [presentation-mvi.md](presentation-mvi.md) instead — same shape, cleaner naming, no `AndroidViewModel`. |
| `compose-utils` nav helpers | `KoltBottomNavigationNavHost.kt`, `KoltNavType.kt` | Built on Navigation 2 (`NavController`/`NavGraphBuilder`), which [navigation.md](navigation.md) has this project moving off in favor of Navigation 3. Not an Android-only-vs-KMP issue — Nav3 supersedes Nav2 for every target. |
| `utils` → `FlowUtils.collectState` / `collectFlows` | `utils/src/commonMain/.../extensions/FlowUtils.kt` | Callback-listener style predating structured concurrency (`successListener`/`errorListener`/`onLoading` triads), and `collect()` bakes in a hardcoded `delay(200)` after every emission — every consumer inherits 200ms of invisible latency. Use `stateIn` + `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` instead. |

## Dead code — don't copy the pattern

`compose-utils/.../base/ViewModelDelegate.kt` is an unused internal class
that duplicates logic already reimplemented by hand elsewhere — two
divergent copies plus one unused third. Don't carry the inconsistency
forward; use the `MviViewModel` in [presentation-mvi.md](presentation-mvi.md).
Full trace in [kolt-libs-reference.md](kolt-libs-reference.md#dead-code--dont-copy-the-pattern).

## Not evaluated

`update-utils`, `bom` — out of scope for this steering set (app-update flow
and Maven BOM packaging, not presentation/theme/navigation). Check them on
their own merits if/when a journey needs in-app update prompts. `update-utils`
in particular is worth a look for an Android-only project specifically — it's
solving an Android Play-Store-update problem that doesn't apply to iOS at
all, so the KMP steering set never had reason to flag it either way.
